# Siamese-network-with-Triplet-Loss

A Siamese Network is a sort of network architecture used to create and compare feature vectors for each input and contains two or more identical subnetworks. Siamese networks can be used for a variety of purposes, including face recognition, duplicate detection, and anomaly detection. A Siamese network with three identical subnetworks is used in this illustration. The model will get three photos, two of which are similar (anchor and positive samples) and one of which is unrelated (a negative example.) Our goal is to learn to estimate the similarity between images.
